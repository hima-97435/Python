# Basic conversion of data types

# String to:
name ="123"

# String to int
print(2*int(name))

# String to float
print(2*float(name))

# Int to:
x =1

# Int to strings:
print("The speed of the fan is at :"+str(x))

# Int to float
print(float(x))

# float to:
y =12.23

# float to int :
print("The int version of y is :"+str(int(y)))

# float to string:
print("The batting team run rate till 10 over is :"+str(y))


# 01)   Woking with differnt data type :
Name ="Himanshu"
Age=19
MAth_mark=67.89
day=True

print("My name is : "+Name)
print("My age is : "+str(Age))
print("My Math mark is : "+str(MAth_mark))
print("Is 1*1 =1 :"+str(day))

# 02 ) For Python version  we can simply type this command in terminal that "python --version".

# 03)  Hetrogenous List --> it is just like ArrayList in Java because it can store values of differnt data type in a single list. 

details_of_student=["Himanshu",6 , 67.89 , True]
print(details_of_student[0])

# 04) Converting a data from one type to another 

# a) int to float
alpha=12
beta=float(alpha)

print(alpha)
print(beta)

A1=12.567
print(A1)
A1=int(A1)
print(A1)

#b) boolean to string


my_bool = True
print(str(my_bool))

# 05) use of input and if else (conditional statement) and perform various arithmetic operation

#  a) Use of If and else conditional statement


# apple_quantity=int(input("How much apple does a yellow basket contain :"))
# print("The apple quantity inside yellow basket : "+str(apple_quantity))


# number=int(input("Enter a number : "))
# if number >0:
#     if number %2 ==0:
#         print("Number is positive as well as even ")
#     else :
#         print("number is positive but not even ")
# else:
#     print("Number is negative ")

# b) perform arithmetic operation with inputs.

n1=int(input("Enter a number :"))
n2=int(input("enter another number :"))

# Sum of two number
print("Sum of the two number : "+str(n1+n2))

# Subtarction of two number
print("Subtraction of two number : "+str(n1-n2))

# Multiplication of two number 
print("Multiplication of two number : "+str(n1*n2))

# division of two number 
print("Division of n1 and n2 is : "+str(n1/n2))

# Modulus of two number 
print("Modulus of  n1 w.r.t n2 number is : "+str(n1%n2))

# Exponent of two number 
print("Exponent of n1 to the power of n2 number :"+str(n1**n2))
